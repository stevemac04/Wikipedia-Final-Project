This project implements various graph operations in Rust, focusing on handling directed graphs. It includes functionality for reading graph data from a file, calculating PageRank, finding minimum distances between vertices, identifying connected components, and more.

## Features
- **PageRank Calculation**: Estimates the importance of vertices within a graph.
- **Minimum Distance Calculation**: Determines the shortest path between two vertices.
- **Connected Components Identification**: Finds and lists all connected components of the graph.
- **Subgraph Creation**: Generates a subgraph from a specified component.
- **Degree of Separation**: Calculates the maximum degree of separation within the graph.
